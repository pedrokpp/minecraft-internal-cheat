# Minecraft Internal Cheat
This was my first ever internal cheat, it was made a long time ago

Because this was made a while ago, some modules are missing because I couldn't find the files lol (if really wanted I could remake this project in a correct way and with the missing modules), but **the reason to share this project is to only show how to get the basics to start with an internal cheat, which are the Minecraft Instance, Player Instance and World Instance**

This was originally made for Minecraft version 1.8.9, at some point I tried to support more versions but I don't think I went ahead...

If you want to implement this in other versions, just change the mappings accordingly

Please check if the mappings are correct and also setup [jni](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Native_Interface) correctly on your Visual Studio in order to properly compile and use it

This code wasn't organized neither made the way it should because I didn't knew much about the topic, so don't judge my code too much, I definitely didn't use proper practices/naming, etc
